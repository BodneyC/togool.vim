Togool
======

A short plugin to swap boolean values in place.

There are one or two others which do the same thing, but they have dependencies I feel aren't necessary and are, in general, a little too chunky for my liking.

## Usage

By default, the plugin creates the command `ToggleBool` and maps the plugin functiont to `<C-b>` which I realise may annoying some [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) users, sorry.

## Configuration

Plugin configuration and some default options are listed in the help file:

    :h togool
